# Privacy Policy

I am a single developer, and I have built Next Set as a commercial app. This app is provided and intended for use as is.

The app does not collect any personally identifiable information of any kind. All information entered into the app by the user is stored on their device and is not sent or collected anywhere else by the app. To put it simply, your data is and remains yours and I have no access to it.

The app may contain links to third-party websites for the purpose for getting in touch with myself, the developer. If you click on a link to a third-party site, you will be directed to that site in your default browser app. Note that these external sites are not operated by myself. I have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.
